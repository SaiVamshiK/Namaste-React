React Fiber is the new and updated reconciliation engine.
virtual DOM is at the end a JS object.
React is fast because of its fast DOM manipulation.
Whole component got re rendered.

When ever we refresh the state of a particular state variable, react would re render the whole component.
Why it rerenders entire component?
This is because the changed state variable might have changed other tags as well. So it re renders entire component where the state variable is in.
