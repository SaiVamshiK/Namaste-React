React Fiber is the new and updated reconciliation engine.
virtual DOM is at the end a JS object.
React is fast because of its fast DOM manipulation.
Whole component got re rendered.

When ever we refresh the state of a particular state variable, react would re render the whole component.
Why it rerenders entire component?
This is because the changed state variable might have changed other tags as well. So it re renders entire component where the state variable is in.

Microservices Application :
Uber has 100's of Microservices in it.
Microservice : Decoupling all applications to build a big project.
Microservice architecture helps in separation of concerns.
The Food villa application we have made is a UI Microservice.
How all the Microservices are connected?
swiggy.com : port 3000 mapped to /
             port 4000 mapped to /app
             port 5000 mapped to /notifications
This is how each Microservice communicated with each other.

Approach 1 : Page Loads => API call => render page.
Approach 2 : Page Loads => render default page => API call => render updated Page.
Approach 2 is better for user experience.
useEffect() is the hook which we use for this.

CORS error happens because our browser is blocking localhost from accessing the swiggy.com's API.
Install the CORS chrome plugin so that browser would not complain.

Inside the JSX we can write Javascript expressions not statements in {}.
