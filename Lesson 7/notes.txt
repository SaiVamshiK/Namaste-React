Order of execution while useEffect's callback function is called.
First the entire body component is re rendered only after that the corresponding useEffect's callback function is called.
If the second parameter in useEffect is not given 
useEffect(()=>{

})
Then the callback function will be called each time the component renders.

REACT SAYS NEVER DEFINE A COMPONENT INSIDE ANOTHER COMPONENT.
BECAUSE WHENEVER THE PARENT COMPONENT IS RE RENDERED, THE CHILD COMPONENT AGAIN GETS CREATED.
Hooks:
NEVER WRITE A useState() inside if else and for loop.
NEVER USE useState() outside a Functional Component.
useState is a hook which allows us to create local state variables for the functional component.
CDN is a better way though to get images rendered in our application.
