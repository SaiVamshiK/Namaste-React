React is a JS Library.
By adding the 2 script tags we have imported React.
In the console of the browser if we type React or ReactDOM we see a dictionary, code which we can use.
React is the core library. This will always be there.
ReactDOM is the library for the DOM.
It is the code Facebook developers have written for us.
IMP : The script tags are loaded in order. So you need to keep your tags in order for using React.
So get the React script tag and ReactDOM tag first then the script tag of the actual manipulation in order to avoid error.
