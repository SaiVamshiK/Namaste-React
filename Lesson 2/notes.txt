Webpack, parcel and vite are the types of bundler.

Most bundlers do the same job : minify the code, remove console logs and do a lot of optimizations.

Bundling is the process of following imported files and merging them into a single file: a “bundle”. This bundle can then be included on a webpage to load an entire app at once.

create-react-app uses Webpack as the bundler.

npm, yarn is a package manager.
npm != node package manager.

npm is used as a package manager in order to manage all our packages.

Initialize a package manager : npm init. Go with all defaults and create it.
(npm init -y is to skip some stuff)

React cannot be just with importing react and reactDOM, we need npm as well. It is like maven for UI.
React needs npm because of the requirement of lot of other packages that are bundled for optimizing, minifying etc. the code.
The packages are present by using npm.

For igniting app we use parcel.
npm install -D parcel is to get parcel bundler into our project. (-D means dev dependency)
dependency means all the packages our project needs.
-D means it is there only on our development machine not production.
