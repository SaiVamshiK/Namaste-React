JSX : HTML Like syntax in JS Code. It is not HTML in JS.

React.createElement Vs JSX:
React.createElement returns a JS object which inturn changes it into HTML code.
React.createElement => JS Object => HTML Code.
JSX avoids the use of multiple React.createElement functions. In the background JSX uses React.createElement to render HTML code. Babel is used for this.
JSX => React.createElement => JS Object => HTML Code.

Benefits of JSX:
Improves readability. Makes developer life easy. 

Babel Role in JSX:
Babel converts JSX => React.createElement => JS Object => HTML Code.
Parcel uses babel as a transitive dependency.

Components :
Functional Component : JS Function that returns a JSX code.
Composing Component : This means using muliple components within a single Functional Component.

{TitleComponent} : where we are injecting a JS variable into JSX.
{<TitleComponent/>} : where we are injecting a React Functional Component into JSX.
{<TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>} : where we are injecting a HTML like tag in JSX.
